# Yildiz App

Yildiz App is a Flutter application designed for managing orders using a PostgreSQL Database.

## Database Configuration

By default, the application is configured to connect to a PostgreSQL database with the following settings:

- Database Name: `YildizDB`
- Username: `postgres`
- Password: `admin`

After sending the first order, the app automatically creates a table named `orders` with the required constraints.

## Features

The Yildiz App comes with a variety of features:

- **Product Home Page**: Features a modern-looking hero view component.
- **Order Form Page**: Allows users to send an order to the database after validation.
- **Order List Page**: Fetches the orders from the database, handles possible errors, and displays them in a table.
- **Settings Page**: Provides standard settings options such as app theme, language, notifications, privacy, and account management.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Yildiz App, clone the repository and ensure you have Flutter installed on your machine. Then, update the database configuration in the application to match your PostgreSQL database settings.
